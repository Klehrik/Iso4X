This project is an extension of the [pseudo-3D isometric renderer](https://github.com/Klehrik/Isometric-Grid) I wrote 5-6 months prior.  
It has all the basics of a turn based tactics game, including the ability to move units around and have them attack other units, although it never got passed this stage before I stopped development.
