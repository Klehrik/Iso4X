Only way i know that allows for 100% accurate perspective is to assign a 3d coord to every element and "raycast" to the camera pos
then draw in order of descending distance

ok ok for height curve just modify a copy of Height instead and lerp that
way easier and looks more accurate
in pipeline_draw use the modified Height (that can be decimal values) instead of actual tile height
